**Fake Job Post Detection**  is a machine learning-based project designed to identify fraudulent job postings and protect job seekers from scams. 
  By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and predictive modeling, this tool analyzes job descriptions and associated metadata to differentiate legitimate postings from fraudulent ones.

**Technologies Used**
Python  
Natural Language Processing (spaCy, NLTK)  
Machine Learning (scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch)  
Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
Dataset Handling (Pandas, NumPy)  

**Future Enhancements**
Integration with job board APIs for live detection.  
Model fine-tuning for multilingual datasets.  
Deployment of a web-based interface for non-technical users.
